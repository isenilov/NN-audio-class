    "## 1. Introduction ##\n",
    "\n",
    "This work represents a practical part of the Neural Networks course taught at Sapienza University.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this coursework is to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Explore the [Google AudioSet](https://research.google.com/audioset/index.html) [1]\n",
    "2. Build the classification model based on Neural Network(s)\n",
    "3. Validate the model\n",
    "4. Evaluate and discuss the results\n",

    "### 2.1 Audio features ###\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature extraction is signal processing task of computing the numerical representation from the signal that can be used to characterize the audio segment [3].\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the audio features fall into three categories [4]:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Energy-based**. For example, 4Hz modulation energy used for speech/music classification [5].\n",
    "2. **Spectrum-based**. Examples of the category are roll-off of the spectrum, spectral flux, Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficents (MFCC) [5] and linear spectrum pair, band periodicity [6].\n",
    "3. **Perceptual based**, like pitch (estimated to discriminate songs and speech over music [7]).\n",
    "\n",
    "The most developed areas of machine learning for audio classification include speech and music recognition where  MFCCs are widely used as features. MFCCs were introduced in 1980 [8] and showed better performance in terms of recognition of spoken words. However, when it comes to other types of sound recognition, the selection of feature extraction method becomes less obvious, even though MFCCs are used in, for example, application to environmental sound classification [9].\n",

    "<img src=\"figs/feat_extr.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Extraction pipelines for MPEG-7 (left) and MFCC (right) features (reprinted from [4])\n",
    "\n",
    "Typical approach of feature extraction process is to split the audio signal into small chunks of several $ms$ (exact size is domain-dependent) and feed it into computational function of one of many frameworks for extraction of features from audio (see Figure 1 and 2 for examples of extraction pipelines for MPEG-7 [10] and MFCC features). The most popular frameworks include YAAFE [11] and openSMILE [12], which allows to extract following feature types:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Amplitude Modulation [13]. Analyzed frequency ranges are: Tremolo (4 - 8 Hz) and Grain (10 - 40 Hz). For each of these ranges, it computes:\n",
    "    * Frequency of maximum energy in range\n",
    "    * Difference of the energy of this frequency and the mean energy over all frequencies\n",
    "    * Difference of the energy of this frequency and the mean energy in range\n",
    "    * Product of the two first values.\n",
    "2. Autocorrelation coefficients $\\mathit{ac}$ on each frame.\n",
    "    $$ac(k)=\\sum_{i=0}^{N-k-1}x(i)x(i+k),$$    \n",
    "    where (here and below) $k$ is frame length in samples, $N$ is length of whole signal in samples and $x(i)$ is signal function.    \n",
    "3. Onset detection using a complex domain spectral flux method [14].    \n",
    "4. Energy $\\mathit{en}$ as root mean square of an audio frame.\n",
    "    $$en=\\sqrt{\\dfrac{\\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}x(i)^2}{N}}$$    \n",
    "5. Envelope of an oscillating signal (smooth curve outlining its extremes).    \n",
    "6. Shape statistics (centroid, spread, skewness and kurtosis) of each frame’s Temporal Shape, Amplitude Envelope and Magnitude Spectrum.    \n",
    "7. Linear Predictor Coefficients (LPC) of a signal frame [15].    \n",
    "8. Line Spectral Frequency (LSF) coefficients of a signal frame [16].    \n",
    "9. Loudness coefficients [17].    \n",
    "10. Mel-frequencies cepstrum coefficients and Mel-frequencies spectrum.    \n",
    "11. Magnitude spectrum.    \n",
    "12. Octave band signal intensity (OBSI) using a triangular octave filter bank and  OBSI ratio between consecutive octave.\n",
    "13. Sharpness and Spread of Loudness coefficients [18].    \n",
    "14. Spectral crest factor per log-spaced band of 1/4 octave.    \n",
    "15. Spectral decrease, spectral flatness.    \n",
    "16. Spectral Flux.    \n",
    "17. Spectral roll-off (frequency so that 99% of the energy is contained below) [5].\n",
    "18. Spectral Slope (computed by linear regression of the spectral amplitude) [18].    \n",
    "19. Spectral Variation (normalized correlation of spectrum between consecutive frames) [18].    \n",
    "20. Zero-crossing rate (ZCR) for frame [5].\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though there are plenty of features available for audio, we focus on MFCCs as they proved to be the most effective representation (See Figure 3 for example heatmap of feature matrix). We also consider raw audio signal to see how automatically learned features (by special Neural Network architecture) perform in comparison with hand-crafted ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figs/spectr.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: center; font-weight:bold\"> Fig.3. Example of heatmap of feature matrix </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Model selection ###\n",
    "\n",
    "As this work is a part of Neural Networks course, we will not consider more traditional Machine Learning algorithms. Other reason for this is that Neural Networks proved to be much more effective in real world pattern recognition problems, particularly in audio classification like shown by [2] and many other researches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, in the next section we would like to check and find out performance of following combinations of feature extraction techniques and network architectures:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **MFCC features + Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (BLSTM) network**, where we use traditional (for audio applications) features with relatively modern Recurrent Neural Network [19,20].\n",
    "2. **Raw audio + Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and BLSTM network**. CNNs are traditionally used in image recognition [21] where 2Dkernels learn features. We use 1D kernels for learning patterns in raw audio signal instead, keeping the original idea of CNN."

    "In this work, I explored the problem of audio classification on the example of Google's AudioSet. Firstly, the existing approaches to features extraction and model building were reviewed. Then the hypothesis of application of CNN to raw audio was checked by implementation of the proposed architectures. We saw that 3-layer BLSTM network on MFCC features yields good results even though it is prone to overfitting. On the other hand, adding CNN layers in the beginning of the network complicates the network significantly but doesn't increase performance (however it doesn't overfit much).\n",
    "\n",
    "Next steps could include extensive testing the different hyperparameters for both implemented networks (varying number and type of layers, number of neurons/filters, size of the filters, regularization, etc.) but it was not done due to limited computational resources and time. The same reason is responsible for absence of cross validation as it would increase training time by k times in case of k-fold cross validation."
